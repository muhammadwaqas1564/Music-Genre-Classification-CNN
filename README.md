# Music-Genre-Classification-CNN
A deep learning-based music genre classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the GTZAN dataset.


This project aims to classify music tracks into different genres using CNNs. The model is trained on the GTZAN dataset, which consists of 1,000 audio tracks spanning ten genres. It leverages Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) for feature extraction and employs convolutional layers for pattern recognition. The system is evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics to improve genre classification performance.
